# Research Network
## _A visualization tool to help uncover the main players within a research field_

This script creates a network plot with the main players in a given research field (adapted from Olivia Tanuwidjaja's post on [Discovering entity connections insights using Network Analytics][credit]).

### How can I interpret the network?
 - Nodes represent authors;
 - Edges represent co-authorship of a paper between two authors;
 - The color of a node corresponds to one of the affiliations of the corresponding author;
 - The size of a node is proportional to the number of papers the corresponding author has authorship;
 - The resulting network can help identify not only research groups, as well as groups that often work together!
